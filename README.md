# Chips & Hame

🍟 & 🏠

An absolutely nothing page, setup using webpack.

## Setup

[Setup instructions](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/#basic-setup)
`npm init -y`
`npm i -D webpack webpack-cli`
`npm install --save lodash`

## Running Webpack

`npx webpack`
`npx webpack --config webpack.config.js` *This just shows how to pass some configuration. If webpack.config.js exists, it'll be used by default*

Adding `"build": "webpack"` to the `scripts` section of `package.json` allows us to run `npm run dev` instead of `npx webpack`
